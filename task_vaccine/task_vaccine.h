 * An identifier of the target process.

 * A full or relative path to the library you want to load into the given
 * target. The library should be compatible with the target task. In order to be
 * meaningful, this library should also contain a constructor function that will
 * be executed on load.
 *
 * @return KERN_SUCCESS
 * The payload was loaded successfully into the target task.
 * @return KERN_INVALID_TASK
 * dlopen() failed to load the given library (e.g. target architecture doesn't
 * match the payload).
 * @return KERN_FAILURE
 * Something gone totally wrong on a task_vaccineâ€™s side. Please open an issue
 * on GitHub.
